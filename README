Prerequisites
-------------
- JDK 8
- Maven 3

Usage
-----

- To build an executable .jar file, use the 'mvn clean package' command.
- To run the application use the 'mvn spring-boot:run' command
  You can also run the built .jar file with the command 'java -jar target/shop-service-1.0-RELEASE.jar'

  The API will be accessible at: http://localhost:8080/shop-service
  Swagger UI will be accessible at: http://localhost:8080/shop-service/swagger-ui.html

Notes
-----

- The REST API accepts date/time values in the following formats:
    1. yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ
    2. yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss in UTC timezone (this custom format and timezone can be adjusted in application.properties)
    3. yyyy-MM-dd (in this case time part will be 00:00:00.000)

- One REST API test relies on the timing of the requests: OrderControllerTest verifies the timestamps of orders using
  the timestamps of the requests used to create the orders. It never happened so far, but in theory it can fail on slow
  machines. In that case increase the constant called DELAY_MS in that class.
